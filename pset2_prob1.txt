#script will find all occurances of "Gainesville" to find all flights from and into; then it will go to the columns 13 and 16 which contain delayed flights; grep will count every occurance which shows up as a '1.00'. This should give the correct answer. 

 grep "Gainesville" prob2_file.csv | awk -F',' '{print $13, $16}' | grep -c 1.00 >> pset2_prob1_answer.txt
